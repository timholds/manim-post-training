# Standardized placeholder for descriptions that will be generated later
# This is used by extractors that have code but no descriptions (or unreliable descriptions)
PLACEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION = "[PENDING_DESCRIPTION]"

# This placeholder indicates that the description needs to be generated by an LLM
# Quality validators should skip validation for descriptions starting with this prefix
# Extractors can append additional context after this prefix if needed
# Example: "[PENDING_DESCRIPTION] - Source: manim_ce_examples, Class: SquareToCircle"
