   - Use LLM to create educational descriptions
   - Validate code-description alignment

2. **Enhance Existing Descriptions**
   - Review and improve vague descriptions
   - Add learning objectives where appropriate
   - Ensure consistent formatting

3. **Code Quality Standardization**
   - Update older Manim syntax
   - Add missing imports where needed

   - Include modular code patterns
   - Create progressive difficulty examples

## Conclusion

The current dataset provides a solid foundation for training a Manim code generation model, with particularly strong coverage of basic mathematical concepts and computer science algorithms. However, to create a truly comprehensive training set, we need to:

1. Dramatically increase domain diversity (physics, chemistry, biology)
2. Add more 3D and advanced animation examples
3. Include real-world data visualization scenarios
4. Generate proper descriptions for the thanks_dataset samples

The plugin-based architecture makes it easy to add new sources, so focusing on high-quality, domain-specific content should be the next priority.
