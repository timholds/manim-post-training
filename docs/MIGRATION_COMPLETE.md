# Migration to Plugin Architecture Complete âœ…

## What Changed

### Old Architecture (Archived)
- **prepare_data_enhanced.py** - 650+ line monolithic script with all sources hardcoded
- Individual extractor scripts for each source
- Manual management of data sources
- Difficult to add new sources

### New Architecture (Active)
- **prepare_data.py** - Clean 300-line main script
- **extractors/** - Plugin-based system
  - Each source is a self-contained plugin
  - Auto-discovery of new sources
  - Standardized interface via BaseExtractor
  - Easy to test individual sources

## Verified Compatibility

The new system produces **identical output** to the old system:
- Same MD5 hashes for train.json and test.json
- Same deduplication behavior
- Same statistics and counts
- All features preserved

## Benefits

1. **Easier to Extend**: Add a new source = create one file
2. **Better Testing**: Test extractors in isolation
3. **Cleaner Code**: 50% reduction in main script size
4. **No Manual Registration**: Auto-discovery of extractors
5. **Better Organization**: Each source manages its own logic

## Usage

```bash
# List all available sources
python prepare_data.py --list-sources

# Process all sources (same as before)
python prepare_data.py

# Process specific sources
python prepare_data.py --sources manimbench bespoke_manim

# With augmentation
python prepare_data.py --augmentation
```

## Adding New Sources

Create a file in `extractors/sources/your_source.py`:

```python
from ..base import BaseExtractor
from ..registry import register_extractor

@register_extractor
class YourSourceExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    source_id = "your_source"
    source_name = "Your Source Name"
    priority = 3  # 1-5 for deduplication
    
    def extract(self):
        # Your logic here
        yield {"description": "...", "code": "..."}
```

That's it! The source will be auto-discovered and available immediately.
