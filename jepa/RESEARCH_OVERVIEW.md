# JEPA for Manim: Bridging visual understanding and code generation

Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) represents a paradigm shift from generative AI toward predictive world models, offering compelling potential for Manim code generation despite no existing implementations. While the specific blog post proposing this application appears unavailable, research reveals that JEPA's core strength in spatial-temporal understanding directly addresses Manim's fundamental challenges with layout, positioning, and animation sequencing. The architecture would require transfer learning from pretrained models rather than training from scratch with limited data, and faces significant technical hurdles in bridging continuous visual representations to discrete code generation.

JEPA operates as an energy-based model that predicts abstract representations rather than raw pixels, learning through strategic masking of visual inputs. This approach, championed by Yann LeCun as the future of AI beyond large language models, has demonstrated remarkable success in video understanding tasks but remains unexplored for code generation applications.

## Current Manim challenges align with JEPA strengths

Research into theorem explanation systems using Manim reveals that current LLMs struggle with three critical areas where JEPA could excel. **API understanding errors** plague existing approaches, with models generating nonexistent functions, incorrect signatures, and invalid parameters - issues that JEPA's structured representation learning could potentially address through better understanding of valid code patterns. LaTeX rendering problems and spatial layout mistakes further highlight the disconnect between language models and visual-spatial reasoning.

JEPA's architecture specifically targets these weaknesses through its **spatial masking strategy** and temporal prediction capabilities. The system learns to understand object relationships, motion dynamics, and spatial consistency - precisely the elements needed for effective Manim animations. V-JEPA 2, the latest variant released in June 2025, achieves 77.3% accuracy on complex video understanding tasks and demonstrates physics understanding from pure observation, suggesting strong potential for animation logic.

The challenge lies in translation. While JEPA excels at understanding "what should happen" visually, no existing implementation bridges this understanding to "how to code it" in Manim. This represents both the primary roadblock and the most exciting research opportunity.

## Technical architecture reveals implementation requirements

JEPA's core architecture consists of three components that would need adaptation for Manim generation. The **context encoder** processes visible patches of input using Vision Transformer backbones, typically ViT-L/16 (300M parameters) or ViT-H/14 (630M parameters). The **target encoder**, updated through exponential moving average, maintains consistent representations. The **predictor module** then forecasts masked representations in abstract feature space rather than pixel space.

For Manim applications, this architecture would require significant modifications. The continuous representation space that makes JEPA efficient for visual tasks creates a fundamental mismatch with discrete code tokens. **Current implementations require 16 A100 GPUs** for training large models, though smaller configurations can run on 1-3 GPUs. More critically, training datasets typically involve millions of samples - V-JEPA 2 used over 1 million hours of video data.

The proposed 50 videos (~500 scenes) would be **categorically insufficient** for training from scratch. Transfer learning becomes mandatory, leveraging pretrained visual understanding to bootstrap code generation capabilities. Even then, the dataset would need careful curation to maximize learning efficiency through strategic examples covering diverse Manim patterns.

## Transfer learning offers the only viable path

Given data constraints, any practical implementation must build upon existing pretrained models. **V-JEPA 2** provides the strongest foundation with its proven spatial-temporal understanding and recent multimodal extensions. The model has already demonstrated successful integration with language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video question-answering tasks at 8B parameters.

The recommended approach involves a hybrid architecture combining JEPA's visual understanding with specialized code generation components. Frozen JEPA encoders would process visual inputs and animation requirements, while **lightweight task-specific layers** learn the mapping to Manim code. This approach has proven successful in robotics applications where V-JEPA 2-AC achieves zero-shot planning with less than 62 hours of robot demonstration data.

Attentive probing techniques, already implemented in V-JEPA, allow adaptation without full model retraining. This efficiency becomes crucial when working with limited datasets, as each training example must contribute maximally to learning the visual-to-code mapping.

## Existing implementations reveal both promise and gaps

Open-source implementations from Meta AI provide starting points but no direct path to code generation. **I-JEPA** (`facebookresearch/ijepa`) offers image understanding capabilities, while **V-JEPA** handles temporal dynamics. The experimental **LANG-JEPA** represents the closest attempt at symbolic prediction, operating in "concept space" rather than pixel space, though it remains far from practical code generation.

The most relevant finding is V-JEPA's demonstrated ability to understand **violation-of-expectation** - detecting when physical laws are broken in videos. This capability suggests JEPA could learn valid versus invalid Manim constructions, potentially catching errors that plague current LLM approaches. **MC-JEPA** additionally incorporates optical flow understanding, directly relevant to animation trajectories.

Community implementations reveal consistent patterns: successful applications focus on visual understanding tasks, while symbolic output remains unexplored. No existing project combines JEPA's spatial reasoning with code synthesis, leaving this integration as novel research territory.

## Model size and computational demands shape feasibility

Practical implementation faces substantial computational requirements that must be carefully considered. Minimum viable configurations start at **ViT-L/16 with 300M parameters**, though optimal performance requires ViT-H/14 (630M) or larger. Training demands multi-GPU setups, with official implementations optimized for 16 A100 80GB GPUs, though smaller experiments can run on 3 GPU configurations.

Memory requirements vary significantly between training and inference. Training typically needs 16-40GB VRAM depending on batch size and model scale. However, **inference requires only a single GPU**, making deployment more practical once models are trained. This asymmetry suggests a development model where specialized teams create foundation models that practitioners then adapt.

Recent efficiency improvements offer hope. V-JEPA achieves **6x faster training** than pixel prediction methods, while I-JEPA trains ViT-Huge in just 72 hours. These advances, combined with transfer learning, could make Manim-specific adaptations feasible even with limited resources.

## Recent Meta AI developments chart the path forward

Yann LeCun's vision for JEPA, articulated through 2024-2025, explicitly positions it as a replacement for current generative AI within 3-5 years. His critique that **"Nobody in their right mind would use generative AI as a central component"** reflects confidence in JEPA's superiority for world understanding tasks. This philosophical stance drives Meta AI's aggressive development timeline.

V-JEPA 2's capabilities hint at possibilities for Manim. The model demonstrates understanding of complex physical interactions, object permanence, and causal relationships - all crucial for generating valid animations. Its **zero-shot robotics planning** proves that JEPA can bridge perception to action, analogous to bridging visual concepts to code.

The absence of code generation applications represents opportunity rather than limitation. As LeCun notes, current JEPA research focuses on perceptual understanding as the foundation for future symbolic reasoning. Manim generation could serve as an ideal test case for this transition, requiring both visual understanding and structured output.

## Challenges demand innovative solutions

Several fundamental challenges must be addressed for successful implementation. The **continuous-to-discrete gap** between JEPA's representation space and Manim's code tokens requires novel architecture bridges. Potential solutions include intermediate symbolic representations or hybrid models combining JEPA with traditional code generation approaches.

Data efficiency poses another critical challenge. With only 50 videos available, every example must be maximally informative. **Curriculum learning** strategies could help, starting with simple animations and progressively increasing complexity. Data augmentation through programmatic generation of Manim examples could expand the effective dataset size.

The lack of established evaluation metrics for visual-to-code generation complicates development. Unlike pure visual tasks with clear benchmarks, assessing whether generated code produces the intended animation requires both syntactic validity and semantic correctness. Developing appropriate evaluation frameworks becomes a research contribution itself.

## Future potential outweighs current limitations

Despite significant challenges, JEPA's alignment with Manim's requirements makes pursuit worthwhile. The architecture's **demonstrated spatial-temporal understanding** directly addresses current LLM limitations. Its efficiency in learning from visual data could reduce the traditional requirement for massive code datasets. Most importantly, JEPA's predictive nature matches the forward-modeling needed for animation planning.

Success would require embracing JEPA's strengths while acknowledging its limitations. Rather than expecting direct code generation, initial systems might focus on high-level animation planning with separate modules handling syntax generation. This modular approach aligns with LeCun's vision of multiple specialized components rather than monolithic models.

The research opportunity extends beyond Manim to broader questions of grounding code generation in perceptual understanding. As development environments become increasingly visual and interactive, JEPA-based approaches could transform how we think about programming tools. Manim, with its tight coupling between code and visual output, provides an ideal proving ground for these concepts.
